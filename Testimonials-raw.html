The Rowperfect rowing simulator has been an integral part of our training since 1997. With the ability to link machines together and also connect them to PCs we\'ve had the opportunity to achieve so much more in our training off the water. Over the period we\'ve made tremendous technical progress. The live feedback from the PCs has enabled the athletes to make changes and see the outcome instantly. The importance of the machines can be gauged by the fact that we bought two machines in Australia and used them right up to our final race in the Olympic final. I\'d be quite happy to use the Rowperfect as our training machine all the time. ”...</div><br /><em><strong>Martin McElroy </strong><br /><small>Coach Great Britain Eight, gold medallists Sydney 2000 Olympic Games</small></em>';

First of all I would like to say that the RowPerfect is a great training tool and for the few days I’ve had it, it earned its money. The information & feedback for the rower is really good. You can see how they change and adapt. I am very impressed. ”...</div><br /><em><strong>Cristian Felkel </strong><br /><small>Head Coach South African Rowing Union</small></em>';

By the way, I forgot to mention that the Rowperfect “Indoor Sculler” has improved my sweep rowing immensely. I cannot believe how after spending long periods away from a sweep boat I can jump into an eight and row with such a comfortable and relaxed technique, immediately from the very first stroke. Furthermore, I use to be just a bowside rower. However after spending so many hours on the Rowperfect I have easily adapted to row on stroke side and now feel just as comfortable on both sides.\"...</div><br /><em><strong>Roland B </strong><br /><small>Melbourne, VIC 2011 </small></em>';

I have always been a fan of ROWPERFECT. Not only does it provide immediate feedback from the visual data but it also gives the rowers a clear message that they can transfer easily to the boat. Using it, from the early development right up to the Olympic final, was a major factor in the success of our Gold Medal Eight. ”...</div><br /><em><strong>Harry Mahon </strong><br /><small>Cambridge University Boat Club and Great Britain Olympic Coach</small></em>';

When changing direction at each end of the stroke, the energy involved with moving (kinetic energy) has to reduce to zero.

As I’m getting used to the rower, I’m amazed at how much work I can do without my back hurting. I think there’s three reasons that is the case – 1) no harsh jerks at the catch, 2) my body is not swinging back and forth along the rail, 3) the wobbly seat forces my core muscles to be more supportive. When I’m rowing correctly on the Rowperfect, it feels like I’m floating. I’m enjoying the machine and feel with only a few days of use that it’s a big improvement over my static rowing machine.\"...</div><br /><em><strong>Mark Katz </strong><br /><small>CA USA</small></em>';

For the last two weeks before I departed for the 1989 World Championships in Bled, I was training on the Rowperfect exclusively. This gave me an advantage over my competitors, because I could hone my timing at the catch to perfection, not hindered by weather conditions or waves, and this certainly contributed to my world championship of that year. ”...</div><br /><em><strong>Frans Göbel </strong><br /><small>World Champion,  l/wt mens</small></em>';

I was lucky to have been introduced to the Rowperfect by Harry Mahon in my early years of rowing. I immediately understood what it meant to push on the legs and hang from the handle. There is absolutely no doubt that my Olympic gold and silver medals are a direct result of smart training, which included lactate testing, sound coaching, cross training, and rowing the Rowperfect on days I chose not to row on the water.

My son introduced the Rowperfect Rowing Simulator to my life and it has been a lifesaver. It enables me to exercise daily without any adverse effects on my knees. It also keeps my heart, blood pressure etc in order, preparing me for surgery and after surgery recovery.

One of the advantages we see with the rowperfect is that the athlete won\'t be moving all over the place like on the other rowing ergometers, which will make it much easier to take blood samples and expired air measurements etc. I can\'t remember if that advantage is mentioned anywhere on your website yet.

I won’t go into too much detail with the physics only to say that in rowing it’s actually the boat that moves back and forwards the most each stroke (relative to the water), and on this machine it’s the flywheel that moves the most each stroke (relative to the ground). The aim of the Rowperfect is for the net effect of flywheel and bodyweight to remain stationary during each stroke, and for most of the energy to be transferred into spinning the flywheel. In a fixed flywheel, a lot of energy is wasted in simply moving the body backwards and forwards.”...</div><br /><em><strong>David Cameron </strong><br /><small>Rowing MagOZine September 2005</small></em>';

Have you ever wanted to own a single piece of exercise equipment that would not only give you a great cardiovascular, but also a demanding strength training workout? Would you then want this machine to need very little in the way of maintenance, and also fit into your spare bedroom or living room, without being too obtrusive? Plus, would you like it to be able to monitor your performance and give you immediate and useful feedback? Oh, and have you ever wanted to row like the Oarsome Foursome? ”...</div><br /><em><strong>Aletha Mays </strong><br /><small>Tested the Rowperfect for 3 months for Australian Ultra-FIT Magazine</small></em>';

Not only has my sweep rowing improved but also has my cross country skiing. On 27/08/11 I competed in an international cross country ski race “Kangaroo Hoppet” at Falls Creek. I had a great result against my peers which required a lot of power endurance to get through 30km off energy sapping deep slushy spring snow. I attribute this to the Rowperfect because several months before the race I decided to take a gamble and replace the running training that I normally do for this race with long workouts on the Rowperfect. It paid off not only in the results but during the race people commented on my skating technique which looked more powerful and relaxed. So now I can honestly say that the Rowperfect erg teaches you to apply increased power in a more relaxed and comfortable manner which benefits whole of body power endurance sports such as rowing and cross country skiing.

One thing ... about using a Rowperfect is that it’s actually enjoyable. I’m sure it’s because it keeps you thinking, and so the boredom factor is greatly reduced.
